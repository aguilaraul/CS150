# Labs

###### 1. Lab 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter two integer numbers, then tells the
user: the sum of the numbers, the difference of the numbers (first minus
second), the product of the numbers, and the quotient of the numbers
with remainder. Each of these should be output as a separate line and include
the equation.

###### 2. Lab 2
- Ask the user to enter their name, print “Hi [name]” to the screen.

- Ask the user whether they are a CS major or not – print the result to the
screen as “CS Major: [result]” (note that this will display numerically – that
is OK for now).

- Ask the user to enter their favorite punctuation mark – print “Your favorite
punctuation mark is: [result].”

- Ask the user to enter two numbers (store them as integers).
    - Display the result of dividing the first by the second both as a decimal
    and as a value and remainder.

You should clearly communicate to the user what they need to enter
for each input, and what you are displaying for each output.

All of your variables must be of appropriate data types

###### 3. Lab 3
Ask the user to enter the names of three items and their prices, and the tax
rate as a decimal. After they enter this information calculate the subtotal,
tax, and total, and print out a receipt as formatted below. The item names may
contain multiple words (assume they will not overflow). The line of stars is 30
characters long.

###### 9. Lab 9
Ask the user to enter an integer (positive or negative does not matter). Repeat
the integer given by the user and tell them whether it is even or odd. After the
user enters the first integer, and after each subsequent integer entered, ask
the user if they wish to enter another integer.  If they answer 'Y' or 'y' then
repeat, if they answer 'N' , 'n', or any other character then tell them how many
odd numbers they entered and how many even numbers they entered.

Note that the user should always enter at least one integer, only ask them
if they have another after the first entry.
